**Problem:** People who meet many new faces struggle to remember names.
**User:** Teachers, salespeople, managers, conference attendees.
**Solution:** Upload photos, gamified flashcard drills, spaced repetition.
**Key Insight:** Learning names requires face-first recall, not name-first. Gamification drives retention.
